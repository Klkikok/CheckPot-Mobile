# CheckPot

Application for a project for IoT

## Info

The application is used for reading the information of your CheckPot device. From the app you can see the temperature, air humidity, soil moisture and light that your plant absorbs. It communicates with the Seeed nRF52840 module over BLE, by subscribing to respected characteristics, and receives the data and presents it on the screen for the user.

## TO BE IMPLEMENTED
A watering system needs to be added. The button "Water the plant" should activate the pump, or open a valve and water the plant.
